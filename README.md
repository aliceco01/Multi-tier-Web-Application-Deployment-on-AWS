# Multi-tier Web Application Deployment on AWS

This project aims to deploy a highly scalable and fault-tolerant multi-tier web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and management.

# Architecture

The infrastructure for the web application deployment consists of the following components:

1. Networking: 
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets, internet gateway, and route tables.

2. Front-end:
 Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of EC2 instances in the public subnet, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
3. Application: ASG of EC2 instances in the private subnet.
4. Database: Amazon RDS instance in a separate private subnet.

# Prerequisites
Before deploying the web application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI configured with the appropriate credentials.
- Access to the project's Terraform code repository.

# Deployment Instructions
Follow the steps below to deploy the multi-tier web application on AWS:

Clone the project repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git


Change to the project directory:


Copy code
cd project-repo
Initialize Terraform and download the necessary providers:


Copy code
terraform init
Review the variables.tf file and update the configuration values as needed.

Modify the desired settings in the main.tf file, such as instance types, network settings, and database configuration.

Preview the infrastructure changes:


Copy code
terraform plan
Review the output and ensure that the planned changes align with your expectations.

Deploy the infrastructure:


Copy code
terraform apply
Confirm the deployment by typing "yes" when prompted.

Wait for the infrastructure provisioning to complete. This process may take several minutes.

Once the deployment is successful, you will see the output containing the URLs and access information for the deployed application.

To destroy the infrastructure and clean up resources when no longer needed, run:
׳
׳׳׳

' terraform destroy
Confirm the destruction by typing "yes" when prompted.

## Monitoring and Management
 
To monitor the deployed infrastructure, access the AWS Management Console and navigate to CloudWatch for metrics, logs, and alarms.
For troubleshooting and debugging, refer to the Terraform logs and AWS service-specific logs.
Update the infrastructure code using Terraform to make changes to the deployment or add new features.
